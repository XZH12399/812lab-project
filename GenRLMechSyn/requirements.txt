# GenRLMechSyn Project Requirements

# Core deep learning framework
torch==2.1.0  # Or a more recent stable version compatible with your CUDA
torchvision==0.16.0 # Usually installed with torch, matching version

# Numerical computation and data handling
numpy<2.0      # Crucial! Pinning below 2.0 to avoid compatibility issues we encountered
scipy          # Often required by networkx for graph algorithms

# Configuration file handling
pyyaml         # For reading .yaml config files

# Transformer utilities
einops         # For efficient tensor manipulation in DiT

# Progress bars
tqdm           # For displaying progress during sampling and training

# Graph analysis in Evaluator
networkx       # For building graphs and checking connectivity/DoF
